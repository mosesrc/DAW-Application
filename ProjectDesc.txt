This project will be my attem to make an online DAW system. DAW systems allow you to do a number of things with audio.
You can edit, record, and modify audio files. You can save your work and bounce out the tracks to a certain file type.

As of now I will try to build basic functionality, I want users to be able to:
    -- Record a file 
    -- play file back
